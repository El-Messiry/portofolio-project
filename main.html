                        BMW M, "M" (for Motorsport) was initially created to facilitate BMW’s racing program, which was very successful in the 1960s and 1970s. As time passed, BMW M began to supplement BMW's vehicles portfolio with specially modified higher trim models, for which they are now most known by the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include modified engines, transmissions, suspensions, interior trims, aerodynamics, and exterior modifications to set them apart from their counterparts. All M models are tested and tuned at BMW's private facility at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany.<br><br><br>

                        The BMW 6 Series is a luxury car with an arching roofline that comes as a coupe, convertible, or fastback sedan called the Gran Coupe, which has longer wheelbase for more rear passenger room.

                        The 6 Series is a cruiser, not a high-performance car (not counting the much more expensive M6 with 560 horsepower).The 6 Series got a minor facelift for 2016, so there are no significant changes for 2017, mostly just new glossy black interior trim, with chrome around the iDrive display.

                        The standard engine in the cruiser BMW 6 Series is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 making 315 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque, enabling it to accelerate from zero to sixty in a quick 5.3 seconds; that's the BMW 640i.Next engine is a V8 making 445 horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque, enabling the BMW 650i to accelerate from zero to sixty in 4.3 seconds; that one-second difference is huge in the seat of your pants.

                        Both engines use an 8-speed automatic transmission.Rear-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available, which BMW calls xDrive.

                        The six-cylinder gets 21/30 miles per gallon City/Highway, 24 mpg Combined.The 6 Series hasn't been crash-tested by the government or insurance industry.Being a high-end German car, there's a ton of available safety equipment, including forward collision warnings with automatic emergency braking at city speeds; blind-spot monitors; a surround-view camera system; and lane departure warnings.Night vision cameras with pedestrian detection and active steering assistants are also available

                        Unlike the regular 5-series, the 2018 M5 is more of a revolution than its sheetmetal suggests. It’s the first M5 with all-wheel drive and without an option for a manual transmission. BMW’s M xDrive is rear biased and funnels torque through an electronically controlled limited-slip differential similar to those on the X5 M and X6 M SUVs. In the M5, though, the system can disconnect the front axle for true rear-wheel-drive hooliganism that, from our brief experience in a prototype, makes this 4350-pound (our estimate) lug feel like an E90 M3. Even in regular mode, the all-wheel-drive setup will allow the rears to slip slightly for douchebag-safe maneuvers on public streets. In 4WD Sport with the stability control set to M Dynamic, slip angles widen, and more torque routes to the active (but non-torque-vectoring) rear differential. For those times when you really want to burn through the last 1/32 of tread, the M5’s stability control is fully defeatable in rear-wheel-drive mode.

                            More power, less weight, a particularly sticky set of tyres and recalibrated software for the adaptive dampers, active differential and engine management system. And a fair bit of carbonfibre.

                            Peak power from the twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six is 454bhp – around 30bhp more than the standard M4, and 10bhp more than the Competition. However, ‘it’s not the extra 10 horsepower, it’s more the extra 50Nm (37lb ft) that makes the difference,’ van Meel says. Max torque is up to 443lb ft, the same output as the M4 GTS.

                            There’s no manual gearbox option for the M4 CS, fitted exclusively with the seven-speed dual-clutch DCT gearbox.

                            In keeping with BMW’s recent protocol, odd numbers indicate four doors, so the (F80) M3 is a four-door five-passenger sport sedan of a higher magnitude than the more common 3 Series. In standard trim, the iconic 2017 M3 comes with staggered-width 18-inch forged alloy wheels, performance tires, and a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 engine making 425 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 406 lb-ft of torque at a mere 1,850 rpm. Driving the rear wheels through a computer-controlled active rear differential, a six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a multi-mode seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) is optional. Standard automatic engine stop/start may be turned off. According to the EPA, the M3 with a manual transmission should earn 17/26 mpg in city/highway, for a combined 20 mpg on premium gasoline. A DCT-equipped M3 loses 2 mpg on the highway for a net loss of 1 mpg in combined driving. In Motor Trend testing, an M3 with the DCT has run 0-60 mph between 3.8 and 4.0 seconds.
